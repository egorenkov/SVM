# üìä Machine Learning Exploration Projects

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks documenting my hands-on exploration of key machine learning concepts. Each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of model behavior and performance.

## üß† Notebooks Overview

### 1. [K Parameter Analysis](K_parameter.ipynb)
- Investigates the impact of different K values in KNN models
- Includes visualization of decision boundaries
- Compares accuracy vs. complexity tradeoff

### 2. [Support Vector Method](Support_vector_method.ipynb)
- Implements SVM with various kernels (linear, RBF, poly)
- Demonstrates the effect of C parameter on margin width
- Contains practical examples of hyperparameter tuning

### 3. [Feature Scaling Study](how_does_scale_affect.ipynb)
- Compares model performance with/without feature scaling
- Tests different scaling methods (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)
- Visualizes how scaling affects convergence

## üîç Key Insights Demonstrated
- Practical understanding of hyperparameter tuning
- Ability to analyze model behavior through visualization
- Experience with sklearn's API and pipeline construction
- Interpretation of model metrics and decision boundaries

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack
- Python 3
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas/NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
